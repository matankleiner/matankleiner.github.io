## <b>Webpage Template</b>

This webpage was originally made by [Matan Kleiner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matan-kleiner/) with the 
help of [Hila Manor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hilamanor/") for [SinDDM](https://matankleiner.github.io/sinddm/") and can be used as a template for any use.

It is inspired by the template that was originally made by [Phillip Isola](http://web.mit.edu/phillipi/) and [Richard Zhang](http://richzhang.github.io/)
 for a [colorful ECCV project](http://richzhang.github.io/colorization/).
the code for the original template can be found [here](https://richzhang.github.io/webpage-template).

A lot of features are taken from [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). All icons are taken from [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

The images in this webpage are all generated by either DALL-E 2 or Stable Diffusion 2.1 Demo.
